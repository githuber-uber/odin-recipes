  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is one of the most favorite dishes of many families: vareniki (Russian pierogi or dumplings) filled with potatoes and fried mushrooms. Serve with sour cream mixed with fresh herbs.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul id="no-style">
    <li>18 ounces potatoes</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
    <li>¼ cup butter</li>
    <li>2 onions, finely diced</li>
    <li>3 ½ cups finely chopped button mushrooms</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and mash; season with salt and pepper.</p></li>
    <li><p>Combine flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl while potatoes are cooking. Stir sour cream and baking soda together in a second bowl. Add water to flour mixture and blend in, followed by sour cream mixture. Knead into a smooth dough, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat and cook onions until browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Add to mashed potatoes.</p></li>
    <li><p>Divide dough into 4 portions and roll each portion into a 1 1/2-inch thick rope. Cut ropes into small 1/2-inch pieces. Press each dough piece into a small flat circle and place 1 teaspoon of potato filling in the center. Fold dough over into a half-moon shape and seal edges.</p></li>
    <li><p>Bring a large pot of salted water to a gentle boil. Add the vareniki in batches and cook until they float to the surface, about 3 minutes. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes more. Remove with a slotted spoon and place in a colander to drain.</p></li>
